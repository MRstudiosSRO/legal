# The recommended procedure for transferring non-public files

The recommended procedure for transferring non-public files to MRstudios (such as construction data in the form of STP files), is to send them in a GPG-encrypted state (the public encryption key of MRstudios will be provided upon request) and via a GPG encrypted channel (e.g. encrypted email). An alternative to this is to protect the files with a secure password (e.g. consisting of 15 characters at a minimum) prior to sending them and subsequently communicating the password to MRstudios via a separate channel (e.g. by phone).
